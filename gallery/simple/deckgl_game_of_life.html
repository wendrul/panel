<span class="s2">**Conway's Game of Life** is a classic demonstration of *emergence*, where higher level patterns form from a few simple rules. Fantastic patterns emerge when the game is let to run long enough.</span>

<span class="s2">The **rules** here, to borrow from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway</span><span class="si">%27s</span><span class="s2">_Game_of_Life), are as follows:</span>

<span class="s2">- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</span>
<span class="s2">- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</span>
<span class="s2">- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</span>
<span class="s2">- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</span>
