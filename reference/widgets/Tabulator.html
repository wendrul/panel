<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tabulator</span></code> widget allows displaying and editing a pandas DataFrame. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tabulator</span></code> is a largely backward compatible replacement for the <a class="reference internal" href="DataFrame.html"><span class="doc std std-doc"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataFrame</span></code></span></a> widget and will eventually replace it. It is built on the <strong>version 5.3</strong> of the <a class="reference external" href="http://tabulator.info/">Tabulator</a> library, which provides for a wide range of features.</p>

<p>When editing a cell the data stored on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tabulator.value</span></code> is updated and you can listen to any changes using the usual <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.param.watch(callback,</span> <span class="pre">'value')</span></code> mechanism.

<h2>Styling<a class="headerlink" href="#styling" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The ability to style the contents of a table based on its content and other considerations is very important. Thankfully <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pandas</span></code> provides a powerful <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/style.html">styling API</a>, which can be used in conjunction with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tabulator</span></code> widget. Specifically the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tabulator</span></code> widget exposes a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.style</span></code> attribute just like a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pandas.DataFrame</span></code> which lets the user apply custom styling using methods like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.apply</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.applymap</span></code>. For a detailed guide to styling see the <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/style.html">Pandas documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Here we will demonstrate with a simple example, starting with a basic table:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">style_df</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pd</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DataFrame</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">randn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">columns</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'ABCDE'</span><span class="p">))</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Next we define two functions which apply styling cell-wise (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">color_negative_red</span></code>) and column-wise (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">highlight_max</span></code>), which we then apply to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tabulator</span></code> using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.style</span></code> API and then display the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">styled</span></code> table:</p>

<h2>Theming<a class="headerlink" href="#theming" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The Tabulator library ships with a number of themes, which are defined as CSS stylesheets. For that reason changing the theme on one table will affect all tables on the page and it will usually be preferable to see the theme once at the class level like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">widgets</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Tabulator</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">theme</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'default'</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For a full list of themes see the <a class="reference external" href="http://tabulator.info/docs/4.9/theme">Tabulator documentation</a>, however the default themes include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'simple'</span></code></p></li>

<p>Sometimes your table will be larger than can be displayed in a single viewport, in which case scroll bars will be enabled. In such cases, you might want to make sure that certain information is always visible. This is where the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">frozen_columns</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">frozen_rows</span></code> options come in.</p>

<p>When you have a large number of columns and canâ€™t fit them all on the screen you might still want to make sure that certain columns do not scroll out of view. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">frozen_columns</span></code> option makes this possible by specifying a list of columns that should be frozen, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">frozen_columns=['index']</span></code> will freeze the index column:</p>

<h4>Frozen rows<a class="headerlink" href="#frozen-rows" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Another common scenario is when you have certain rows with special meaning, e.g. aggregates that summarize the information in the rest of the table. In this case you may want to freeze those rows so they do not scroll out of view. You can achieve this by setting a list of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">frozen_rows</span></code> by integer index (which can be positive or negative, where negative values are relative to the end of the table):</p>

<h2>Row contents<a class="headerlink" href="#row-contents" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A table can only display so much information without becoming difficult to scan. We may want to render additional information to a table row to provide additional context. To make this possible you can provide a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">row_content</span></code> function which is given the table row as an argument (a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pandas.Series</span></code> object) and should return a panel object that will be rendered into an expanding region below the row. By default the contents are fetched dynamically whenever a row is expanded, however using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">embed_content</span></code> parameter we can embed all the content.</p>
<p>Below we create a periodic table of elements where the Wikipedia page for each element will be rendered into the expanded region:</p>

<h3>Hierarchical Multi-index<a class="headerlink" href="#hierarchical-multi-index" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tabulator</span></code> widget can also render a hierarchical multi-index and aggregate over specific categories. If a DataFrame with a hierarchical multi-index is supplied and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hierarchical</span></code> is enabled the widget will group data by the categories in the order they are defined in. Additionally for each group in the multi-index an aggregator may be provided which will aggregate over the values in that category.</p>
<p>For example we may load population data for locations around the world broken down by sex and age-group. If we specify aggregators over the â€˜AgeGrpâ€™ and â€˜Sexâ€™ indexes we can see the aggregated values for each of those groups (note that we do not have to specify an aggregator for the outer index since we specify the aggregators over the subgroups in this case the â€˜Sexâ€™):</p>

<h2>Pagination<a class="headerlink" href="#pagination" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>When working with large tables it is generally not advisible to display the whole table at once. In these scenarios we can enable either <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'local'</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'remote'</span></code> pagination, which will render only a single page of data at the same time. In the case of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'remote'</span></code> pagination only the currently viewed data is actually transferred from the backend server to the frontend and new data is fetched dynamically when we switch the page or filter and sort the data. Note that Panel will automatically enable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'local'</span></code> pagination for tables larger than 200 rows and enable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'remote'</span></code> pagination for tables larger than 10 000 rows. This protection may be overridden by explicitly setting the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pagination</span></code> parameter.</p>
<p>The pagination setting may be enabled by setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pagination='remote'</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pagination='local'</span></code> and the size of each page can be set using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">page_size</span></code> option:</p>

<h3>Constant and Widget filters<a class="headerlink" href="#constant-and-widget-filters" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The simplest approach to filtering is to select along a column with a constant or dynamic value. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.add_filter</span></code> method allows passing in constant values, widgets and Param <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Parameter</span></code>s. If a widget or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Parameter</span></code> is provided the table will watch the object for changes in the value and update the data in response. The filtering will depend on the type of the constant or dynamic value:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>scalar: Filters by checking for equality</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code>: A tuple will be interpreted as range, the <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> bounds being both included in the range. Setting one of the bounds to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> create an open-ended bound.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set</span></code>: A list or set will be interpreted as a set of discrete scalars and the filter will check if the values in the column match any of the items in the list.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As an example we will create a DataFrame with some data of mixed types:</p>

</div>
<p>Now we will start adding filters one-by-one, e.g. to start with we add a filter for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'A'</span></code> column, selecting a range from 0 to 3:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">filter_table</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_filter</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="s1">'A'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Next we add dynamic widget based filter, a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RangeSlider</span></code> which allows us to further narrow down the data along the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'A'</span></code> column:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">slider</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">widgets</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">RangeSlider</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">end</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'A Filter'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">filter_table</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">slider</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'A'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lastly we will add a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MultiSelect</span></code> filter along the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'C'</span></code> column:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">select</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">widgets</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MultiSelect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">options</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'foo1'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'foo2'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'foo3'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'foo4'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'foo5'</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'C Filter'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">filter_table</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'C'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now letâ€™s display the table alongside the widget based filters:</p>

<h3>Client-side filtering<a class="headerlink" href="#client-side-filtering" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the Python API the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tabulator</span></code> widget also offers a client-side filtering API, which can be exposed through <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">header_filters</span></code> or by manually setting filters in the rendered table. The API for declaring header filters is almost identical to the API for defining <span class="xref myst">Editors</span>. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">header_filters</span></code> can either be enabled by setting it to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code> or by manually supplying filter types for each column. The types of filters supports all the same options as the editors, in fact if you do not declare explicit <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">header_filters</span></code> the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tabulator</span></code> widget will simply use the defined <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">editors</span></code> to determine the correct filter type:</p>

<h2>Downloading<a class="headerlink" href="#downloading" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tabulator</span></code> widget also supports triggering a download of the data as a CSV or JSON file dependending on the filename. The download can be triggered with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.download()</span></code> method, which optionally accepts the filename as the first argument.</p>
<p>To trigger the download client-side (i.e. without involving the server) you can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.download_menu</span></code> method which creates a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TextInput</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Button</span></code> widget, which allow setting the filename and triggering the download respectively:</p>

<p>The easiest way to patch the data is by supplying a dictionary as the patch value. The dictionary should have the following structure:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="o">...</span>

</pre></div>

<p>As an example, below we will patch the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'bool'</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'int'</span></code> columns.

<p>These and other available <em>Tabulator</em> options are listed at http://tabulator.info/docs/5.3/options.</p>
<p>Obviously not all options will work though, especially any settable callbacks and options which are set by the internal Panel tabulator module (for example the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">columns</span></code> option).
Additionally it should be noted that the configuration parameter is not responsive so it can only be set at instantiation time.</p>
